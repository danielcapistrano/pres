	abstract = {The most widely used measure of segregation is the so‐called dissimilarity index. It is now well understood that this measure also reflects randomness in the allocation of individuals to units (i.e. it measures deviations from evenness, not deviations from randomness). This leads to potentially large values of the segregation index when unit sizes and/or minority proportions are small, even if there is no underlying systematic segregation. Our response to this is to produce adjustments to the index, based on an underlying statistical model. We specify the assignment problem in a very general way, with differences in conditional assignment probabilities underlying the resulting segregation. From this, we derive a likelihood ratio test for the presence of any systematic segregation, and bias adjustments to the dissimilarity index. We further develop the asymptotic distribution theory for testing hypotheses concerning the magnitude of the segregation index and show that the use of bootstrap methods can improve the size and power properties of test procedures considerably. We illustrate these methods by comparing dissimilarity indices across school districts in England to measure social segregation.},

	abstract = {Residential segregation is an inherently spatial phenomenon as it measures the separation of different types of people within a region. Whether measured with an explicitly spatial index, or a classic aspatial index, a region’s underlying spatial properties could manifest themselves in the magnitude of measured segregation. In this paper we implement a Monte Carlo simulation approach to investigate the properties of four segregation indices in regions built with specific spatial properties. This approach allows us to control the experiment in ways that empirical data do not. In general we confirm the expected results for the indices under various spatial properties, but some unexpected results emerge. Both the Dissimilarity Index and Neighborhood Sorting Index are sensitive to region size, but their spatial counterparts, the Adjusted Dissimilarity Index and Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index, are generally immune to this problem. The paper also lends weight to concerns about the downward pressure on measured segregation when multiple neighborhoods are grouped into a single census tract. Finally, we discuss concerns about the way space is incorporated into segregation indices since the expected value of the spatial indices tested is lower than their aspatial counterparts.},

            Quantitative indices of segregation are powerful tools for summarising the spatial relationships between population groups and thereby providing the basis for analysis and public policy intervention. While the broad concept of segregation may be intuitive, measurement is challenging because of the complexity of varied dimensions and spatial arrangements. Many traditional measures can be criticised for over‐simplification or over‐reduction, not least in their treatment of geographical space. Over the last several decades, however, a series of measures has been developed to explicitly incorporate the spatial arrangement of population groups as well as their interactions. This paper reviews the development of spatial segregation measures, particularly focusing on the mathematical formulation of spatial arrangement/relations. In addition, several related issues are discussed, including representation of spatial interaction, spatial scale and statistical inferences. Also, this paper presents an overview of existing software tools that are readily available for calculating some of the reviewed measures. Finally, discussions on challenges and future research are provided.},

Dramatic changes in metropolitan landscapes over the past two decades, however, demand an expanded theoretical framework that can account for stability and change. In this article, we review research on contemporary urban changes that offers insights for explaining segregation's persistence amid widespread change. We identify three broad categories of mechanisms that exacerbate inequities by race and class in residential sorting processes: resource inequality, hierarchy endurance, and consolidated power. We describe developments in measuring segregation and new data and methods for studying urban change that enable researchers to consider the contemporary mechanisms, forms, and scales of segregation in the twenty-first century.

This article attempts to provide evidence that the Irish state played a central role in facilitating and shaping labour supply, a role that has resulted in the clustering of non-Irish workers in particular sectors of the labour market. Worker mobility across national borders takes place at the intersection of global economic trends and local or regional labour market development, thus creating global consistency in the operation of local or regional markets and demand for workers; however, each labour market is unique as each creates its own local and global social relations. The state, as a main actor in the formulation of immigration policies and in shaping labour market structure, has a central role in affecting the nature of the interconnection between global and local. The analysis considers how Ireland’s immigration policies, as they reflect global labour trends, contribute to the clustering of certain migrants in particular sectors. The method of analysis involves a three-step numerical analysis of clustering: (1) percentages, (2) ODDS ratios and (3) two-step cluster analysis. Results suggest the existence of economic clustering and channelling of workers into specific jobs linked back to immigration policies and recruitment drives.},

Integration processes – for example, settlement services in key areas such as employment, education and social inclusion – help to enhance integration outcomes. In this paper, we use the example of the Republic of Ireland to show that the relationship between desired integration outcomes and the provision of settlement services needs considerably more attention. We present immigrant integration outcomes for specific regions and groups of immigrants derived from existing large-scale data sets. We then use publicly available data on existing settlement services to assess the extent to which settlement services address key areas of immigrant integration outcomes. We demonstrate that there are considerable gaps in the provision of appropriate settlement services that could support the enhancement of key integration outcomes, such as the quality of work, language proficiency and housing. If immigrant integration outcomes are to be improved, the relationship between outcomes and settlement service provision has to be better coordinated and targeted to address the structural barriers faced by particular groups of immigrants and by immigrants living in particular regions.},

The study, based upon a survey of 60 migrants complemented by 20 in-depth interviews, questions how integration should be understood: in particular it suggests that—in some respects—integration may be difficult for all low-wage precarious workers, whether migrants or not. The study also highlights how migrant workers retain agency—the capacity to act, to make decisions, and appropriate certain places—even in challenging circumstances.},

We aim to address these shortcomings by creating a unique data set of linked Census geographies spanning five Censuses since 1971. These yield a large enough sample to estimate the local impacts of immigration using a novel spatial panel model which controls for endogenous selection effects arising from migrants being attracted to high-employment areas. We illustrate our approach with an application to London and find that no migrant group has a statistically significant long-term negative effect on employment. EU migrants, however, are found to have a significant positive impact, which may have important implications for the Brexit debate. Our approach opens up a new avenue of inquiry into subnational variations in the impacts of immigration on employment.},

First, the relationship between migrants' qualifications and employment is examined. Second, employment-related language barriers are discussed, because as English proficiency increases so does the likelihood of success in the labour market.

	title = {Rural restructuring and rural in-migration patterns in {Ireland}},
	url = {https://dspace.mic.ul.ie/handle/10395/1989},
	abstract = {In recent decades, the rural economic base in Ireland, similar to that of other developed countries across the globe, has witnessed a period of significant structural change, with academic literature coining the term rural restructuring to classify and describe this socio-economic transition. The restructuring or reshaping of rural areas is strongly influenced by the processes and patterns of globalisation. As a result, there has been a knock-on effect on population structure. Some locations, particularly those in close proximity to urban centres and with high levels of connectivity, have thrived whilst others, that are considered to be peripheral, have declined dramatically. In the past decade, there has also been a significant change in the ethnic composition of the population in Ireland. The foreign national population has steadily increased in both absolute and relative terms, from 5.8\% (224,261) in 2002 to 12\% (320,096) in 2011 (CSO, 2012). Despite the severe economic downturn, the number of foreign nationals has continued to increase, with a 124,624 rise in the number of foreign nationals between the 2006 and 2011 Censuses of Population. The changing ethnic profile of Ireland is not a purely an urban phenomenon, with specific rural areas types witnessing a dramatic and sizeable inflow of economic migrants from across the globe. In some instances, this has occurred through the establishment of asylum centres in rural locations, but this thesis is solely examining the role of economic migrants who can legally and legitimately work in Ireland. On average, foreign nationals account for 5.8\% of the total population residing in ‘pure’ rural areas (excluding towns and villages), with specific rural locations having a significantly higher proportion. 
This thesis examines the linkages between rural restructuring and rural in-migration in Ireland and presents research findings from two contrasting case studies, specifically Counties Monaghan and Limerick. The utilisation of a cross-section of methodological tools, incorporating household and business questionnaires; and semi-structured interviews, whilst including secondary data analysis, provided a robust and triangulated approach to achieving the principle aim and objectives of this research project. Key findings from this study include: the diversification of the rural economic base providing employment opportunities for economic migrants (confined to particular rural area types), especially within low-paid and low-skilled occupations; the emergence of ethnic orientated / migrant businesses in locations with a high density of immigrants; a low labour market (job generation) multiplier effect associated with net in-migration; and a desire amongst in-migrants to remain resident at their current location for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, this thesis documents and analyses the various integration and diversity raising awareness initiatives / programmes devised by statutory and non-statutory agencies, thereby enabling the forging of positive community relations between the migrant and indigenous communities. However, these initiatives are currently being curtailed or abandoned due to a lack of financial resources. This thesis concludes by predicting future socio-economic and demographic changes within rural Ireland and by providing a list of recommendations for key stakeholders (migrant and indigenous communities; policymakers; statutory agencies; and community and voluntary sector) with respect to harnessing the socio-economic potential of migrants within a rural space.},

This book provides a new and original approach to understanding contemporary Irish migration and immigration, showing that they are processes that need to be understood together rather than separately. It uses a wide range of data – from statistical reports to in-depth qualitative studies – to show these connections. The book focuses on four key themes – work, social connections, culture and belonging – that are common to the experiences of immigrants, emigrants and internal migrants. It includes a wide selection of case studies, such as the global GAA, the campaign for emigrant voting, and the effects of migration on families. Clearly written and accessible, this book is an invaluable resource for students and scholars of Irish migration.

Most of the maps show where internal migrants in the United Kingdom lived: these included maps of 'the national element', 'the Irish element', 'the Scotch element' and 'the English element'. Ravenstein drew attention to the gender dimension of migration in 1885, suggesting that there were differences in the likelihood of migration and in the distance migrated between men and women. This chapter shows how Censuses may be used, in Ireland and elsewhere, to highlight situations where people's experiences and opportunities may be restricted or limited because of their status as immigrants. In Ireland, the Census offers three possible identifiers of migrancy. These are nationality, place of birth and living outside Ireland for at least a year. In general, records of migrant stock are more comprehensive than records of migrant flows.},

We use representative survey data and administrative records to measure cultural preferences and economic outcomes of refugees and German residents, and construct a threat index that integrates contemporaneous and historical variables on xenophobia at the local level. We document that refugees assigned to more hostile regions converge to German culture more rapidly, but do not ﬁnd a job more quickly and experience slower earnings growth. We provide evidence that, by heightening threat perceptions, local hostility prompts refugees to adopt German culture more quickly. However, higher discrimination in these regions slows down refugees’ economic integration.},

While it is known that the characteristics of these regions affect the overall employment probability of refugees, previous studies have not investigated how refugees’ chances of regaining their pre-migration occupation are affected by the local opportunities to ﬁnd employment in these occupations. To address this gap, we use a large survey of refugees in Germany and link local-occupational labor market characteristics to their region of residence and pre-migration occupation. We decompose the effects of these detailed context characteristics by estimating linear probability regressions with and without ﬁxed effects for regions and/or occupations. While our analyses show that the employment probability of refugees is indeed strongly inﬂuenced by the general local characteristics of their place of residence and general, nationwide characteristics of their pre-migration occupation, our analyses also show that the chances of refugees being employed in their pre-migration occupation are additionally driven by the local characteristics of their occupation. More speciﬁcally, our models reveal that a one standard deviation higher local share of foreigners in refugees’ pre-migration occupation increases the average probability of an occupational match by around 25 percent.},

Meanwhile, existing research largely emphasized residential space and ignored other activity disparities. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of urban segregation, we identified new migrants and two settled urban groups from two kinds of human mobility data. A S-T-A-D-I interactive framework was proposed to measure segregation from multiple activity dimensions, including spatial colocation, temporal coexistence, accessibility, activity diversity, and social interaction. Two-scale analysis of spatial colocation patterns reveals residential segregation by both residential location and housing type, suggesting the effectiveness of the mobility data in profiling socioeconomic groups. The temporal disparity in undertaking activities was unveiled by identifying temporal coexistence patterns. Moreover, the groups presented significant inequality in accessibility owing to the use of different travel modes, leading to a notable disparity in activity diversity. Jointly determined by the disparities in space, time, and diversity, the three groups generated a high level of self-segregation, and new migrants and transit users presented very low interaction potentials with the car group.},

	abstract = {The recent significant inflow of international migrants into rural areas in Europe has raised questions about the integration of migrants into the rural host localities. Amidst the growing literature, there are, however, few comprehensive analyses of processes of migrants’ social integration. Drawing on the lived experience of Polish migrants in a rural area in Norway and applying the theoretical framework of social exposures, the article illustrates the important role of the migrants’ position on the local labour market, the socio-demographics of the receiving locality and the material and geographical properties of the area for the dynamics of their social integration. Findings show how migrants’ desires to engage in migrant/non-migrant relationships are challenged by the increasingly ethnically divided local labour market, amidst growing migration to the location and by the geographical structure of the locality. The changing and intersecting character of those domains fosters conditions that promote primarily social exposure of the migrants to their own co-ethnics, isolating them from the local community. At the same time, the study illustrates that mutual engagement of the migrants and the local inhabitants, as well as having children, play a significant role in diversifying migrants’ local social contacts.},

Eurostat, OECD, and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) official data was mainly used to capture essential international migration indicators (for both dimensions—economic and humanitarian), along with education, socio-economic development and labor market credentials, as key variables for immigrants’ integration into EU-10, compiled for 2000–2017. In this respect, spatial analyses, bootstrap estimations, structural equations (SEM), and Gaussian graphical models (GGM) are applied, to better grasp migrants’ labor market outcomes. Significant positive consequences reflected through a reduction in the unemployment rate of the foreign population are generated by active labor market policies, jointly with an enhancement in the attainment for secondary education, and welfare advances. The opposite, a rise in income inequalities has negative effects, while additional support for R\&D activities deployed within the business sector is required to entail migrants’ labor market performance. The passive policies need to be redesigned and tailored to significantly downsize the foreign unemployment, since these are currently acting like a disincentive for an active participation of migrants on the European labor market, thus confining their integration.},

Drawing from ethnographic interviews carried with migrants in Lisbon, Portugal, I argue that looking at migrants as skilful agents in the practice of city life may capture how the mechanics of migrant emplacement work in the context of urban diversity.},

Thus, Government interest in regional and spatial issues has ebbed and flowed in reaction to the events and economic climate of the day; during the 1950s interest surged in reaction to rural decay, emigration and economic failure, waned with entry in to the European Economic Community in 1973 and the prolonged recession of the 1980s and re-emerged in response to growing congestion problems arising from the ‘Celtic Tiger’ at the turn of the century and led to the publication of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) in 2002. This history is outlined and brought up to date, to incorporate recent developments, such as the publication of the government strategy document ‘Putting People First’. It is hoped that this may provide context to facilitate forthcoming deliberations around the recently announced ‘replacement’ NSS for Ireland.},

	abstract = {The US Census provides the primary source of spatially explicit social data, but changing block boundaries complicate analyses of housing growth over time. We compared procedures for reconciling housing density data between 1990 and 2000 census block boundaries in order to assess the sensitivity of analytical methods to estimates of housing growth in Oregon. Estimates of housing growth varied substantially and were sensitive to the method of interpolation. With no processing and areal‐weighted interpolation, more than 35\% of the landscape changed; 75–80\% of this change was due to decline in housing density. This decline was implausible, however, because housing structures generally persist over time. Based on aggregated boundaries, 11\% of the landscape changed, but only 4\% experienced a decline in housing density. Nevertheless, the housing density change map was almost twice as coarse spatially as the 2000 housing density data. We also applied a dasymetric approach to redistribute 1990 housing data into 2000 census boundaries under the assumption that the distribution of housing in 2000 reflected the same distribution as in 1990. The dasymetric approach resulted in conservative change estimates at a fine resolution. All methods involved some type of trade‐off (e.g. analytical difficulty, data resolution, magnitude or bias in direction of change). However, our dasymetric procedure is a novel approach for assessing housing growth over changing census boundaries that may be particularly useful because it accounts for the uniquely persistent nature of housing over time.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the right to work for migrant workers in Ireland. The right to work, as recognised in international human rights instruments, encompasses a range of interrelated rights. However, economic and labour market developments at local and global levels play a key role in defining the right to work. Diverse views in relation to conceptions of the right to work and the obligations of states highlight the complexity and controversial nature of these issues. A human rights framework recognises the indivisibility of the right to work from other fundamental human rights where the standards set out in international human rights instruments are reflected in national policies and practices, and ensures that national remedies are in place to address violations. States have the power and responsibility to make legislative and policy choices to protect, promote and fulfil human rights. Legislative and policy choices in Ireland have resulted in a two-dimensional system based on nationality and skill/qualification level. The result is that non-European Economic Area (EEA)/Swiss migrants, especially Black and minority ethnic migrants, and migrants in low-skilled employment areas are particularly vulnerable. In terms of moving towards a human rights framework in Ireland, legislative and policy choices should ensure the development of an employment permit system that is underpinned by the principle of permanence and prevents exploitation, strengthen anti-racism and anti-discrimination strategies, and support integration. However, legislative and policy choices need to be made within a human rights framework which considers state obligations in the context of greater dialogue between those engaged with labour rights, human rights and economic theory and in the context of domestic and global concerns.},

	abstract = {Education is becoming international, across all levels of educational systems. This is most visible in higher education, where internationalisation has come to have a variety of meanings. These include the internationalisation of curricula; institutional strategies of internationalisation; the convergence of education systems (e.g. the influence of the Bologna reform process in European higher education); and internationalisation policies at regional, national and supranational scales (Kehm and Teichler 2007: 265). The internationalisation of education is not only happening in universities. Internationalisation is also taking place through language teaching, specifically what Park has called the 'English frenzy' (Park 2011: 446). The global growth in the private English language teaching industry takes a number of forms: the recruitment of native English (or, often, white) teachers in countries such as South Korea, Japan and China, to teach both children and adults; and the growth in the number of private language schools in English-speaking countries, like the UK, Australia and Ireland, which provide tuition in English as well as an initial route to legal migration. There is also some evidence of internationalisation at primary and second level. Examples include the so-called 'wild geese' families from South Korea, where children - accompanied usually by their mother - are sent abroad to study. Similar patterns are evident in the astronaut families and parachute or satellite children from Hong Kong, Taiwan or China. In these cases, entire families move to the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and eventually a parent, usually the father, returns to the original country to work. Sometimes both parents return, leaving the children alone to study (Waters 2015). The internationalisation of education is a widespread, and growing, phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Throughout much of Europe, new waves of immigration have raised concerns about cultural fragmentation and disunity, interethnic conflict, and growing antipathy toward immigrants. Our goal is to provide evidence of uneven patterns of immigrant population distribution and residential integration, both within and between countries of the European Union. Our analyses focus on the spatial concentration of the foreign-born population in 27 countries and 1396 sub-regional areal units (called NUTS3), which in turn are nested within larger economic and cultural regions (i.e., NUTS2). Estimates of new forms of multiscale segregation (i.e., using the index of dissimilarity) are calculated from data drawn from Eurostat and a variety of other sources. Descriptive multivariate models of population concentration or macro-segregation center on key economic (i.e., GDP per capita), social (i.e., education), and ecological (i.e., urbanization) predictors of segregation within and between European countries. New forms of spatial segregation are expressed demographically in substantial regional heterogeneity among immigrants throughout Europe. Multivariate analyses indicate that immigrant-native patterns of population concentration and distribution vary widely between and within European countries with very different economies, demographic conditions, and histories of immigration. In almost all European countries, immigrants from outside of Europe are less spatially integrated with the native population than are immigrants from other countries within Europe. Differences in immigrant-native spatial integration are clearly reflected in the large numbers of immigrant regional “hot spots,” which are driven by public policy and idiosyncratic political considerations at the national and regional levels. Our comparative approach provides an overview of country-to-country differences in European immigrant settlement patterns and multiscale patterns of integration and segregation.},

	abstract = {Integration has become both a key policy objective related to the resettlement of refugees and other migrants, and a matter of significant public discussion. Coherent policy development and productive public debate are, however, both threatened by the fact that the concept of integration is used with widely differing meanings. Based on review of attempted definitions of the term, related literature and primary fieldwork in settings of refugee settlement in the UK, the paper identifies elements central to perceptions of what constitutes 'successful' integration. Key domains of integration are proposed related to four overall themes: achievement and access across the sectors of employment, housing, education and health; assumptions and practice regarding citizenship and rights; processes of social connection within and between groups within the community; and structural barriers to such connection related to language, culture and the local environment. A framework linking these domains is presented as a tool to foster debate and definition regarding normative conceptions of integration in resettlement settings.  The Author [2008].

It uses existing large-scale data sets for the Republic of Ireland to show differences in integration outcomes, measured using the Zaragoza indicators, for three of the country's eight NUTS 3 regions. The analysis shows that there are marked differences in immigrant integration outcomes across regions and highlights the different regional barriers to and enablers of integration. The paper concludes that geographers should advocate for a more nuanced understanding of immigrant integration as a spatialized process and should insist on the importance of making relevant data available at a range of spatial scales.},

Housing supply is defined as the proportions of new housing, private rental accommodation and social housing among all housing units in an electoral district. Multivariate regressions reveal that, among all three housing supply variables, the proportion of private rentals had the largest effect on ethnic diversity and immigrant— Irish segregation. Areas with higher proportions of private rental units were more ethnically diverse, had greater presences of Africans, Asians and eastern Europeans (as opposed to high concentrations of Irish nationals) and exhibited greater integration between each of the three immigrant groups and Irish nationals. The article concludes with a discussion of immigrant assimilation and questions whether the patterns of residential integration observed would further facilitate other forms of social inclusion for immigrants in Irish society.},

In that context, it examines the impact of immigrant settlement patterns on socio-spatial inequalities in the city in the years 1996—2006, a period of economic boom. It finds that, while immigrants in Dublin were segregated to a certain degree, with a slight tendency to cluster in disadvantaged areas, clustering provided a small element of social lift to disadvantaged areas and generally contributed to a significant reduction in socio-spatial inequalities that occurred in the city in the period.},

However, how it affects these outcomes is conditional on levels of local residential segregation. It is only residents living in high minority share areas that are residentially segregated who report higher anti-immigrant sentiment and Brexit support. In fact, living in high minority share areas that are residentially integrated appears to improve attitudes and reduce Brexit support.},

However, comparisons of the levels of segregation between two, or more, cities at the same point in time can be complicated by different spatial contexts as well as ethnic, racial, and class distributions. The extent to which differences in segregation between two cities is due to differences in spatial structure or to differences in composition remains an open question. This paper develops a framework to disentangle the contributions of spatial structure and composition in carrying out comparative segregation analysis. The approach uses spatially explicit counterfactuals embedded in a Shapley decomposition. We illustrate this framework in a case study of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S.},

After describing four ways to conceptualize the measurement of multigroup segregation—as the disproportionality in group (e.g., race) proportions across organizational units (e.g., schools or census tracts), as the strength of association between nominal variables indexing group and organizational unit membership, as the ratio of between-unit diversity to total diversity, and as the weighted average of two-group segregation indices—we derive six multigroup segregation indices: a dissimilarity index (D), a Gini index (G), an information theory index (H), a squared coefficient of variation index (C), a relative diversity index (R), and a normalized exposure index (P). We evaluate these six indices against a set of seven desirable properties of segregation indices. We conclude that the information theory index H is the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory index, since it alone obeys the principle of transfers in the multigroup case. Moreover, H is the only multigroup index that can be decomposed into a sum of between- and within-group components.},

            Economic inequality, international migration and urban transformation have generated fresh interest in segregation and given new social significance to questions of socio‐spatial separation and interaction. At the same time, advances in data, methods and theory are opening up new avenues of inquiry that push the focus beyond simple measures of unevenness of residential patterns towards more nuanced analysis of spatial asymmetry, structure and scale. There is also a drive towards considering spaces and activities outside the neighbourhood, bringing new richness to our understanding of how various social groups interact in the various aspects of their lives. These processes and complexities form the backdrop for our special issue and we reflect on the implications for future priorities in research on segregation in the twenty first century.},

The concept of social capital - the processes by which individuals and groups invest in social relationships and share resources between themselves - resonates with current concerns about the ways in which different communities, notably minority ethnic groups, relate to their wider social world. The report outlines how, since the 1990s, the increasing volume and diversity of migrants has affected the UK's political landscape. It reviews how the government has prioritised the need for social cohesion, to counter the perceived challenges which new migrants pose to a cohesive 'national identity'. This stance marks a significant shift away from the longstanding promotion of multicultural race relations and the acceptance of 'difference'.},

The aggregate relationship between extended contact and intergroup attitudes was r = .25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = [.22, .27], which reduced to r = .17, 95\% CI = [.14, .19] after removing direct friendship’s contribution; these results suggest that extended contact’s hypothesized relationship to intergroup attitudes is small-to-medium and exists independently of direct friendship. This relationship was larger when extended contact was perceived versus actual, highlighting the importance of perception in extended contact. Current results on extended contact mostly resembled their direct friendship counterparts, suggesting similarity between these contact types. These unique insights about extended contact and its relationship with direct friendship should enrich and spur growth within this literature.},

            This article examines how the location, function and quality of immigrant accommodation facilities, regulated by local housing policies, shape the perceived effects of immigration on the well‐being of residents and immigrants in three villages in the Netherlands. Drawing on semistructured interviews with local government representatives, residents and Romanian and Polish immigrants, we show how the different locations of the immigrant accommodations condition social interactions between residents and immigrants and, in this process, reinforce social hierarchies and inequalities. We illustrate how, sometimes unintentionally, spatial policies prepare the stage for conflicts to arise between immigrants and residents, shaping the latter's experiences of migration irrespective of the behaviour of the former. For immigrants, the location of their accommodation sets the limits to what they can do in terms of private behaviour and social relations, exposing them to social control and evaluation.},

	abstract = {Access to adequate housing is a fundamental human right. Yet, several vulnerable groups, including people with a migrant background, often face significant barriers in finding a home. They experience exclusion through discrimination in the access to housing, the consumption of poorer quality housing and the high cost of housing relative to income. This study investigates the relationship between access to housing for migrants, their specific housing needs, and the barriers to access to decent and affordable housing in the Private Rented Sector (PRS) in Ireland. Drawing on applied social science research methods, this research applies a qualitative research approach and policy document analysis to explore access to housing among migrant communities in Ireland, at this critical juncture of the post- global pandemic and the widespread housing affordability crisis. 

This research highlights that the migrant housing experience is significantly impacted by a complex blend of discrimination, practical challenges, and aspirational goals. The analysis of the data identifies three main elements shaping this experience: housing discrimination, strategies for overcoming challenges, and housing future aspirations. Firstly, housing discrimination poses a major barrier for migrants, making it difficult for them to secure accommodation. Secondly, migrants face multiple challenges in obtaining housing, such as navigating intricate processes, dealing with financial limitations, and securing mortgages, but they utilize various strategies to manage these difficulties. Lastly, despite these obstacles, migrants have clear aspirations for their housing future, including a strong desire for homeownership and specific housing preferences often associated with their sociocultural backgrounds. Ultimately, the research results provide a foundation to inform future research and policy, offering evidence-based recommendations and insights for overcoming disadvantages in migrant housing and supporting more equitable housing outcomes.},

	abstract = {Migrant integration allows migrants to contribute to the economic, social, cultural and political life of the country they migrate to; it is also important for social cohesion and inclusive growth. By examining how migrants fare relative to the majority population in key life domains, this report seeks to illustrate the challenges, successes and opportunities for migrant integration in Ireland today. Monitoring integration can provide crucial information for policy and public conversations around migration, and the profile of migrants in Ireland.

Ireland’s migration context has changed considerably in recent years: there have been relatively high numbers of arrivals from Ukraine to Ireland, and a marked increase in the number of people seeking international protection since the last monitoring report on integration. A rise in the cost of living and an acute shortage of housing continue to be significant challenges for all living in Ireland, including many migrants.

This report is the ninth in a series of monitoring reports on integration that began in 2011. It considers how migrants – generally defined as those born outside the State – fare relative to the Irish-born population across four key life domains: employment, education, social inclusion and active citizenship. The report also provides updates on migration and integration policy. Integration indicators are based on high-quality, nationally representative survey data for the latest available time points, supplemented with administrative statistics on forced migrants, where possible. Key headline figures are presented in Table A: individual chapters disaggregate migrant groups by region of origin.

Chapter 1 presents recent trends in migration and provides a profile of the migrant population in Ireland. The rise in immigration since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic continued into 2024, nearly reaching its 2007 peak. The 2007 peak was dominated by migration from within the European Union (EU): recent patterns indicate a shift towards non-EU migration, for work, study and international protection. In 2023, 22\% of the population were born outside the State: just over half of this subgroup was born in the United Kingdom (UK – including Northern Ireland) or the EU, while the remainder was born across a diverse range of non-EU countries. This is an increase from 20\% born outside the State in 2021.},

In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of long-term migrant integration in Western Europe to investigate theories of migrant assimilation and integration. We take a multidimensional approach, looking at 10 indicators measuring social, structural, political, civic and cultural integration. We take an innovative approach to measuring minority background by using two complementary measures: generational status, distinguishing first and second-generation migrants from the third and higher up ‘natives,’ and self-reported ancestry, separating those with autochthonous-only ancestry from those with various kinds of allochthonous ancestry. Using interaction effects between these measures, we can test whether generational change is faster or slower for some ethnic groups than for others, i.e. whether different groups integrate at differing speeds. Using the pooled samples of all Western European countries included in the European Social Survey rounds 7 and 8, we run multivariate regression analyses to estimate the effects of migrant background on the 10 indicators of integration. Compared to migrants with autochthonous ancestry, respondents of Middle Eastern, North African \&amp; Central Asian as well as Sub-Saharan African ancestry are less integrated on all dimensions of integration except the political and civic ones. The South \&amp; South-East Asian group is also substantially less assimilated socially and culturally, but not so much structurally. They are closely followed by the South East and East European groups, following the same pattern except that the latter are less integrated politically as well. We only find substantial interaction effects between ethnic group and migrant generation for two integration indicators, namely citizenship and homophobia, for which speed of integration thus appears to differ across ethnic groups. For all other indicators, integration speed does not appear to differ across ethnic groups, supporting straight line assimilation theory, with social integration in terms of interethnic friendship potentially rather following a ‘bumpy-line’ pattern.},

	abstract = {Residential segregation is a central factor in explaining socioeconomic gaps across race and ethnicity in the United States. Place of residence directly impacts access to schools, jobs, and health care. There is an ever-evolving literature across the social sciences disciplines documenting the general patterns in residential segregation as well as the causes and consequences of those patterns. This article reviews key parts of that literature. We provide an overview of the measurement of segregation and the general evolution of segregation patterns over time and at different scales. We then review the literatures on both segregation’s determinants and its impact on a range of socioeconomic outcomes. We highlight the potential for new insights to be gained from new approaches to quantifying segregation and new frameworks such as stratification for understanding its complex roots.
